# PAAT (Phylogeny-aware Abundance Testing)

PAAT is a framework to test for differential abundances in 16S rRNA gene sequencing data.

By using phylogenetic information of (Z)OTUs/ASVs PAAT can identify signals exhibited by sub-trees of the initial phylogenetic tree.
The method does not depend on classification using databases, which is error-prone due to wrong annotations of references sequences or uncertain assignments.
